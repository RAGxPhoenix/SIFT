# SIFT
SIFT-based image feature detection and matching using OpenCV. Detects keypoints, computes descriptors, matches with Lowe’s ratio test, and refines using RANSAC for homography estimation. Evaluates robustness under rotation, scale, and illumination changes. Extended to image stitching for seamless panoramas with quantitative performance analysis.
